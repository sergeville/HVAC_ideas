## 1. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Primary Issue:** Missing or corrupted system frameworks

**Category:** System

**Affected Processes:**
- kernel

**Error Count:** 3 errors detected

**Evidence:**
1. ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed, AE_NOT_FOUND...
2. Sandbox: applicationd(3456) deny(1) file-read-data /System/Library/PrivateFramew
3. USB device enumeration failed: Device not responding...

## 2. CONSENSUS DECISION

**Selected Fix:** #2 - Repair System Frameworks and Permissions

**Recommendation:** APPROVE - Safe first-line fix for framework issues

**Risk Level:** Low

**Why This Fix Was Chosen:**

*Missing framework errors indicate corrupted system files or permission issues. Rebuild framework cache and repair permissions.*

**Benefits:**
- Safe
- non-destructive operation
- Fixes framework loading and permission issues

**Considerations:**
- Rebuilding cache may take 5-10 minutes
- Requires sudo privileges

**Impact Assessment:**
- System Impact: LOW - Standard system maintenance, no configuration changes
- Application Impact: LOW - May require app relaunches, but no data loss

---

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

**Prepare the system:**
   - Ensure you have admin privileges
   - Close all running applications
   - Have at least 5-10 minutes available (process cannot be interrupted)

**Step 1: Rebuild dyld shared cache**
```bash
sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force
```
   - This rebuilds the system framework cache
   - Takes 3-5 minutes depending on Mac speed
   - Do NOT interrupt this process

**Step 2: Reset Launch Services database**
```bash
sudo /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
```
   - Rebuilds framework registration
   - Fixes application launch issues

**Step 3: Repair disk permissions (if needed)**
```bash
sudo diskutil repairPermissions /
```
   - Note: On macOS 10.11+, this may not be necessary
   - System auto-repairs permissions on updates

**Step 4: Restart the system**
```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## 4. VERIFICATION STEPS

**Immediate Verification:**

1. **Check for new errors in logs:**
   ```bash
   # Check last 5 minutes for errors
   log show --last 5m --level error
   ```
   Expected: No new errors related to the original issue

2. **Verify affected processes are stable:**
   - Monitor SpringBoard in Activity Monitor
   - Verify services: `sudo launchctl list | grep com.apple`
   - Test framework loading: Launch System Preferences

3. **Run diagnostic again:**
   ```bash
   # Capture logs for 1 hour and analyze
   log show --last 1h --level error > post_fix_logs.txt
   python3 execution/parse_macos_logs.py post_fix_logs.txt
   ```
   Expected: Significant reduction in error count

**Long-term Monitoring (24-48 hours):**

4. **Monitor system stability:**
   - Watch for crash reports in Console.app
   - Check `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` for new crashes
   - Verify applications launch and run normally

5. **Performance check:**
   - Open Activity Monitor and check CPU/Memory usage
   - Verify no processes are stuck or consuming excessive resources

6. **If errors persist:**
   - Capture new logs and run through the multi-agent system again
   - The issue may require escalation to Apple Support
   - Consider the next-best fix from Phase 2 debate

## NOTES

- This plan was generated through multi-agent consensus
- Agent Alpha (Investigator) proposed the fix based on diagnostic data
- Agent Beta (Architect) evaluated system/app impact
- Agent Gamma (Coordinator) structured this execution plan

**Before proceeding:**
1. Back up important data
2. Ensure you have admin privileges
3. Set aside adequate time for implementation
4. Document any deviations from this plan

**If this fix does not resolve the issue:**
Run the diagnostic again and the system will propose alternative solutions.
