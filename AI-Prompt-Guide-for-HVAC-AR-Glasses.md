To get the most out of an AI-powered headset (like the RayNeo X3 Pro or similar AR glasses), your prompt needs to be specific about the **environment**, the **tools** you are using, and the **output** you expect.

Here are three ways to rewrite your text, depending on what you are trying to achieve:

### **Option 1: The "Assistant" Prompt (Best for Real-Time Help)**

Use this if you are wearing the glasses and want the AI to guide you through a repair.

"I am an HVAC technician performing a diagnostic. Using the camera on my glasses, please analyze the **control board** and **electrical diagram** I am looking at. Identify the terminal points for the 24V control circuit, help me cross-reference the wiring with the schematic, and suggest a troubleshooting step-by-step for a 'No Cooling' call based on the status lights you see."

### **Option 2: The "Software Capability" Prompt (Best for Research)**

Use this if you are asking a manufacturer or an AI (like me) if a specific device is capable of the job.

"Can the camera and onboard AI of these glasses handle real-time **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for complex HVAC electrical diagrams? Specifically, I need to know if the interface can overlay digital labels on physical control boards, interpret low-voltage wiring configurations, and provide interactive troubleshooting guides based on visual input from the job site."

### **Option 3: The "Concise & Technical" Prompt**

Use this for a quick, direct search or a fast AI query.

"Act as an HVAC diagnostic expert. Use my camera feed to analyze this control interface. Identify any visible faults in the wiring or scorched components, and map the physical controls to the digital wiring schematic provided. Focus on signal flow and voltage test points."

**Why these are "Better" Prompts**

* **Role-Play:** Starting with "I am an HVAC technician" or "Act as an expert" tells the AI to use professional terminology (e.g., "common wire," "contactor," "manifold pressures") rather than layperson terms.  
* **Specific Context:** Mentioning "24V circuits" or "status lights" tells the AI exactly what to look for in the image.  
* **Actionable Goals:** You aren't just "looking" at it; you are asking for "step-by-step troubleshooting" or "mapping."

### **A Note on Hardware Limitations**

If you use the **RayNeo X3 Pro** for this:

* **Pros:** It is great for translation and simple text reading.  
* **Cons:** The camera quality and the AI's ability to read complex, fine-lined electrical diagrams may be limited. You may need to hold your head very still or use a "Capture" mode rather than a live stream to ensure the AI can see the small text on the schematics.

**Would you like me to create a custom "Standard Operating Procedure" (SOP) prompt that you can save and use every time you start a new repair?**
