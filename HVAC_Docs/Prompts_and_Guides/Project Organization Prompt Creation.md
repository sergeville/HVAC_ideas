It sounds like you want to transform a cluttered project directory into a high-performance workspace by prioritizing only the most critical files.

Here is a prompt you can use with an AI (or a script) to help you organize your files safely and logically.

### **The "Essential Root" Organization Prompt**

**System Goal:** Restructure my project directory to achieve a "Minimalist Root" and a "Centralized Documentation" system.

**Step 1: Naming the Project**

* Please check if the current project has a clear name.  
* **Important:** If no project name is suggested or detected, **ask me for a name** before performing any file movements.

**Step 2: Centralize Documentation**

* Identify all documentation files (PDFs, Markdown, text guides, spreadsheets).  
* Move these files into a single, centralized folder named **"Project\_Docs"** or **"\[ProjectName\]\_Docs"**.

**Step 3: Clean the Root Folder**

* The **Root Folder** must contain ONLY "Essential" and "Must-Have" items.  
* **Essential items** are defined as those crucial for survival, daily function, or the specific end-goal of this project.  
* Move all non-essential, secondary, or "nice-to-have" files into a subfolder named **"Archive"** or **"Support\_Files"**.

**Step 4: Confirmation**

* Before finalizing the move, show me a list of the proposed folder structure for approval.

**Tips for Execution**

* **Survival Items:** In a technical project, this usually means the main execution file or the configuration file (e.g., main.py or config.json).  
* **Daily Function:** These are the files you open every single day. If you haven't opened a file in a week, it should probably move to the "Project\_Docs" or "Archive".

Would you like me to help you draft a **folder hierarchy** for your specific type of project (e.g., a photo library, a work project, or a budget) before you run this prompt?
